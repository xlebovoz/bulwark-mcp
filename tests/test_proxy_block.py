"""End-to-end test: the proxy blocks a live prompt-injection attack.

This is the headline assertion for v0.2 — we run the *real* CLI in a
subprocess, with the detector enabled and a tiny YAML config pointing
to a temp DB. The "MCP server" is plain ``cat``, which echoes every
JSON-RPC line back. We feed a tool-call response carrying a canonical
prompt-injection marker and assert two things:

1. The proxy's stdout (the channel that would reach the agent) does
   *not* contain the original payload — it contains the sanitised
   replacement with ``isError: true``.
2. The audit log records the original frame with ``det_verdict='BLOCK'``
   and ``det_action='block'``.

Ollama is *not* required — we use the rules-only path by setting
``llm.enabled: false`` in the config so this test runs deterministically
in CI.
