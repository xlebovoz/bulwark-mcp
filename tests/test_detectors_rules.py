"""Tests for the rules detector (ADR-0004 §2).

These tests cover three concerns:

1. **Loader correctness** — bad YAML, bad regex, bad direction, duplicate
   ids all surface clean errors at load time, never at detection time.
2. **Detection correctness** — direction filtering, score aggregation,
   PoC samples sourced from public prompt-injection corpora.
3. **Builtin packs** — the rules shipped with the package compile and
   the marquee patterns fire on canonical attack strings.
