"""stdio proxy between an MCP client (e.g. Claude Desktop) and an MCP server.

See ADR-0001. The shape is intentionally small:

- We launch the real server as a subprocess with no shell (argv form).
- Two pumps copy newline-delimited frames between the client and the server.
- Every frame is parsed best-effort and pushed onto an :class:`EventBuffer`
  for asynchronous, batched persistence.
- We never write our own diagnostics to stdout — that channel belongs to
  the JSON-RPC frames flowing to the client.

I/O abstraction
---------------

In production the proxy is launched by Claude Desktop, so stdin/stdout are
anonymous pipes — :func:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.connect_read_pipe` and
``connect_write_pipe`` accept those happily. When the proxy is launched from
a normal shell or under test runners, those fds may be a tty or a regular
file, which the asyncio pipe transports refuse with ``ValueError``. We fall
back to blocking I/O on a worker thread, exposed through the same async
:class:`_LineReader` / :class:`_LineWriter` interface so the pump code stays
unchanged.
